            <h1>VALORANT</h1>
            <p>In February 2021, Paper Rex entered the VALORANT 
                competitive scene, signing the original CS:GO
                team as the first iteration of the roster. Although
                the roster had a rough season, they learned a lot as a team.
                
                During the 2022 season, our roster was top-notch,
                securing 1st place in both stages of the APAC(Asia-Pacific)
                Challengers. Furthermore, our roster had a amazing performance
                at international tournaments, placing 4th and 2nd at both Masters
                tournaments.
                
                Our roster had a rough start coming into the 2023 season, placing 17th-32th
                in the LOCK//IN international tournament but we quickly picked things
                back up, securing 1st place in the Pacific League, 3rd at Masters Tokyo, and 2nd at Champions 2023.
