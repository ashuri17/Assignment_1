        <p>About:

            Paper Rex is an esports organization based in Singapore co-founded in 
            January 2020 by Harley "dsn" Ã–rwall, Nikhil "nikH" Hathiramani and 
            Matt 'Djojo' Djojonegoro.
            
            Our mission is to give every gamer something to look forward to, something to get behind,
            and something that they can call their own.
            
            We are mainly known for our VALORANT competitive division,
            a team that has stayed at the very top for the past two years, achieving high placements at
            many international tournaments and still hungry for international trophies.
